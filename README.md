# algorithmic-fairness
Repo for the algorithmic fairness project


1. We first implement a global surrogate method using a Decision Tree Classifier

2. Then we estimate your own black-box machine learning model:
- Random Forest

3. We analyze the performance of our own model : 
- Accuracy 
- F1-score 

4. Global interpretability we use the PDP and ALE method to interpret our own model and compare the different methods

5. Local interpretability : we implement the ICE, LIME and SHAP methods to interpret our own model and compare them.

6. Assess the fairness of your own model with respect to age. Use a statistical test for 
the following three fairness definitions: Statistical Parity, Conditional Statistical Parity 
(groups are given in the dataset), and Equal Odds. Discuss your results


7. Implement a FPDP using a fairness measure. Discuss your results.


Other things we did for creativity: 
Global : 
- PFI
Local :
- anchor
- protodash
